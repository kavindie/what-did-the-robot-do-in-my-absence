4,1,4,2,4,4,5,2,4,2,Would be nice if a button on the image could jump to the point in the video to verify the existence or context . It was inconsistent with the naming of objects and showing if something doesn't exist. Would be nice to requery to check if something existed outside of those top 4 images for example if there was 5 doors.
